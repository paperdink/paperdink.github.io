## Specifications

1. **ESP32-WROOM-32** powerful module
2. **FCC/CE Certified** WiFi & Bluetooth wireless connectivity to unlock the full potential of paperd.ink
3. **Tri-color & monochrome** 400x300 px e-paper displays for the 2 variants Merlot and Classic
4. **<20uA** current consumption in sleep mode means longer battery life and more freedom to create
5. **CP2104 USB-UART** converter onboard for easy programming and updates 
6. **MicroSD Card** slot for convenient storage of images, files, and more
7. **Piezo Buzzer** provides notifications and alerts for a more interactive experience
8. **4x Tactile Buttons** for user input and control
9. **Extension Header** for easy interfacing and expansion of capabilities, enabling limitless creativity and hacking possibilities
10. **1900mAh** LiPo battery allows you to keep your e-paper projects running without worrying about running out of power

<p>&nbsp;</p>

1. **UART, SPI, and I2C** so you can easily add external sensors and modules to your paperd.ink device, making it highly extendable and customizable. This means you can create even more complex and sophisticated e-paper display projects.
2. **8 I/O pins** for controlling any output and receiving any input.
3. **Save power** with paperd.ink. The ESP_EN pin allows you to disable the ESP32 module when you need to, and the LDO_EN pin lets you disable the entire board for virtually no current consumption.
4. **High battery life** using the LDO_EN pin which lets you disable the entire board, reducing power consumption to virtually zero and allowing you to conserve battery life for your e-paper projects.
5. **Pin definitions** header file is [here →](https://github.com/paperdink/PaperdInk-Library/blob/main/src/pin_assignment.h).

## Components Interfacing 
Paperd.ink is designed to be power efficient. Thus, the electronic paper display (EPD), SD card, and battery sense circuits are powered by a MOSFET that can be turned off when not in use. All enable pins are active low, meaning they must be set to low to turn on the circuitry.

For example, to use the EPD, set EPD enable pin (GPIO 12) to low to provide power to the EPD and perform necessary display functions. Once display is updated set the EPD enable pin (GPIO 12) to high to reduce power consumption.

## Battery Specifications & Charging
paperd.ink Classic and paperd.ink Merlot come equipped with a 3.7V (nominal) 1900 mAh LiPo battery, which offers extended battery life for your e-paper projects. 

paperd.ink devices have an inbuilt LiPo charger so the battery can be charged using a 4.2V charging voltage. Simply connect a type-C cable to charge the battery, and the red LED will light up to indicate that charging is in progress. Once charging is complete, the LED will switch off.
